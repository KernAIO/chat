# CLAUDE.md — Kern project rules

Rules for anyone (human or AI agent) working on Kern repositories. These apply to every repo in the KernAIO org.

## We build in the open
The repositories are **public**, so every commit is visible the moment it is pushed:
- Never commit secrets, tokens, personal data, or machine-specific paths. Use `.env` (gitignored) + `.env.example`.
- Write READMEs, docs, and issue/PR text for external contributors, not for ourselves.
- Keep commit history clean and meaningful — it is part of what people judge the project by.
- Every repo carries LICENSE, CLA.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md.
- **Two licences, split at the framework boundary.** The `kernel` repo and `modules`'
  `_template` + `workflow` are **Apache-2.0** so anyone can write a closed module; the product —
  `shell`, `core`, `chat`, `mail`, `collab`, `docs`, this umbrella, the first-party modules — is
  **AGPL-3.0-only**. A new package inherits its repo's licence unless it is something a third-party
  module must import, and then it is Apache-2.0 with its own LICENSE file. Apache-2.0 packages take
  only permissive dependencies. If a module author has to import an AGPL package to get something
  done, move the API — never the licence. See `LICENSING.md` and
  `docs/adr/0005-licensing-and-the-module-boundary.md`.

## Git
- Author identity: `Navid Mirzaaghazadeh <mirzaaghazadeh@icloud.com>` (already set in each repo's local git config — plain `git commit` is correct; do not override with `-c`).
- **Do not add `Claude-Session:`, `Co-Authored-By: Claude`, "Generated with", or any AI trailer/branding to commit messages, PRs, or code comments.**
- Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, with optional scope). Imperative mood, ≤ 72-char subject.
- Push to `origin main`. Never force-push. If `git pull --rebase` complains about unstaged files that aren't yours (parallel agents share worktrees), use `git -c rebase.autoStash=true pull --rebase`.
- **Never `git add -A` or `git add .`. Stage the paths you changed, by name.** Several agents share
  these checkouts, and another one is very often part-way through a new package in the same repo.
  `git add -A` sweeps their half-finished files into your commit and pushes them — under your commit
  message, without their lockfile entry, so CI fails at install for everyone. It happened on
  2026-08-24: a contact-address fix carried two unfinished modules into `main`. Run
  `git status --porcelain` first and stage from it; if you cannot name every path you are about to
  commit, you are not ready to commit. When it does happen, do not revert the other agent's files —
  they are still working on them; tell them instead, and repair what you broke.

## Layout & workflow
- Umbrella dev workspace: `app/` with sibling repos cloned under `app/repos/<name>` (gitignored there). pnpm links all `@kernhq/*` packages via the umbrella workspace.
- Install dependencies ONLY via `app/scripts/pnpm-install-locked.sh` (serialises pnpm at the umbrella root).
- Node 24 (`nvm use 24`), pnpm 10, TypeScript ~5.9, ESM/NodeNext, Biome for lint+format (run `pnpm exec biome check --write <paths>` before committing), Vitest.
- Contracts first: changes to `@kernhq/contracts` / module contracts land (and build) before their consumers.
- Modules own their data: Postgres schema `mod_<id>`, `workspace_id` + RLS on every tenant table, cross-module access only via `kernel.call()` and events. See `modules` repo `packages/_template`.
- Ports: shell 5173 · core 4000 · chat 4100 · mail 4200 · collab 4300 · docs 4400.
- Dev DB on this machine: Homebrew Postgres 18 at `localhost:5432` (`kern`/`kern`); the compose Postgres listens on `${KERN_PG_PORT:-5432}` (5433 here).

## CI
Every service repository's CI runs the real suites, so the workflow starts the infrastructure they
need as service containers: Postgres (`pgvector/pgvector:pg18`) everywhere, Valkey for `chat`,
Mailpit for `mail`. Things learned the hard way:
- Address a service container as **127.0.0.1**, never `localhost` — a runner resolves `localhost` to
  `::1` first, where the published port is not listening, and `fetch` does not retry over IPv4.
- Do not set `registry-url` on `actions/setup-node` in an install job. It writes an `.npmrc` with a
  placeholder token, and npm answers a bad token with **404**, so public packages appear to vanish.
- A repository is built **standalone** in CI. `workspace:*` only resolves inside the umbrella
  workspace; depend on the published version instead.
- **Each repository's own `pnpm-lock.yaml` is what CI installs from, and you cannot refresh it from
  inside the umbrella.** Add a dependency to a package and the umbrella install updates the *umbrella*
  lockfile, leaving the repo's committed one stale — CI then fails every job at
  `ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE`, install-time, before a single test runs. Plain `pnpm install` in
  `repos/<name>` walks up and attaches to the umbrella; `--ignore-workspace` skips `packages/*` and
  cheerfully reports nothing to do. Clone the repo somewhere outside the workspace and run
  `pnpm install --lockfile-only` there, then copy the lockfile back.
- Skipping a test because its infrastructure is missing is fine on a laptop and dishonest in CI.
  Fail when `process.env.CI` is set.

## Writing
Documentation — READMEs, guides, runbooks, `docs/`, and any procedure someone follows — uses the
`adhd-friendly-ste-technical-writer` skill in `.claude/skills/`: goal first, one action per step,
short sentences, conditions before commands, an observable result after every important action.
It is a house style inspired by ASD-STE100, not certified compliance — do not claim otherwise.
It governs documents for readers. Code comments and commit messages keep the voice they have.

## Quality bar
- `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build` must pass before pushing.
- UI follows `shell/DESIGN.md` (Ink/paper design system) and must work in RTL (fa/ar) and dark mode.
- All user-facing strings go through i18n (Paraglide) — no hardcoded English in components.

## Keeping this file current
This file is how the next person — or the next agent — avoids repeating what we already worked out.
When you learn something durable, add it here **in the same commit as the change that taught you**:
- a trap that cost you time (a silent failure, a misleading error, a tool that lies about success)
- a convention you had to infer from reading several files
- a decision and the reason behind it, especially where the obvious choice is wrong
Keep it specific and short. Delete anything that stops being true — a stale note is worse than none.

# This repository: chat (messaging and the realtime gateway)

Hosts the chat module and the **WebSocket gateway that every module shares**. Runs on **:4100**;
sockets connect to `/ws`.

**Things worth knowing**
- The protocol lives in `@kernhq/contracts` (`realtime.ts`). Both sides must agree, so change it there
  first, not here.
- A browser cannot read the HttpOnly session cookie, so a first-party client sends **no token** in
  `hello` and the gateway authenticates from the cookie on the upgrade request. Bearer tokens remain
  for API and native clients. Every socket was rejected until this was handled.
- Services never write to sockets. They publish through `kernel.realtime`, which fans out over NATS
  (`kern.rt.ch.*`, `kern.rt.user.*`); each replica forwards only what its own sockets subscribe to.
  Publishes made inside this process skip the round trip.
- Presence lives in Valkey with a TTL so it survives a restart and expires on its own. Marking a user
  offline when their last socket on *this* replica closes is approximate across replicas — deliberately.
- Unread and mention counters are per member and updated on write. Do not compute them by counting
  messages at read time.
- `kernel.realtime.change()` has to be teed into the gateway like `toChannel`/`toUser`. Taking it
  straight from the inner realtime publishes to NATS only, and on a single node nothing ever comes
  back — every entity change silently failed to reach a socket until this was covered by a test.
- Presence is stored as `{"status","at"}` JSON under `presence:<userId>`. Writing a bare status string
  still "works" but `readPresence` cannot parse it and reports everyone as plainly `online`.
- Tests boot the real service (`src/testing/harness.ts`), stub the handful of core procedures on the
  kernel broker, and drive real WebSockets. The chat module resolves to its **built** `dist`, so rebuild
  `@kernhq/module-chat` after changing it or the suite silently tests the old code.
